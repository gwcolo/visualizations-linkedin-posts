# LinkedIn Posts

## Overview

This repo is where I collect the little visualizations, figures, and snippets of analysis that I share publicly (for example, on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glen-wright-colopy/)).

Since most of my “day job” repositories are private, I realized I didn’t have much to show publicly. I've really enjoyed seeing what other people had to share...so I decided it was only fair to start putting some of my own work out here.  

This as a gallery of quick, self-contained notebooks — each one designed to be read in isolation, run top-to-bottom, and produce a figure or two. 

Quick Notes:
- Notebooks 
    - Notebooks are titled by date of the LinkedIn post.
    - Outputs are scrubbed to keep it clean
- Figures
    - Stored in outputs, so you can see the results from github
- Data
    - I try to avoid putting a lot of data in my repos.
    - Where possible I'll aim to call or generate the data in-notebook
    - If a small bit of example data is available, I'll put it in the "data/sample" folder.
